    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These Buffalo chicken sliders, made with shredded chicken tossed in spicy Buffalo sauce and ranch dressing, baked on Hawaiian sweet rolls with plenty of melty cheese, are good for a game day crowd, or a quick and easy family dinner.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>cooking spray</li>
        <li>1 (12 ounce) package Hawaiian sweet dinner rolls (such as King’s Hawaiian®)</li>
        <li>6 ounces Monterey Jack cheese, shredded (about 1 1/2 cups), divided</li>
        <li>3 cups finely shredded cooked chicken breast, warmed</li>
        <li>1/4 cup cayenne pepper hot sauce (such as Frank’s RedHot®)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup ranch dressing</li>
        <li>1 (1 ounce) envelope ranch dressing mix, divided</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Line a large-rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil; lightly coat with cooking spray. Using a serrated bread knife, cut rolls in half horizontally, keeping top halves and bottom halves intact; place bottom half of rolls, cut-side up, on prepared baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle 3/4 cup of the cheese evenly over bottom half of rolls.</li>
        <li>Stir together warmed chicken, hot sauce, ranch dressing, and 3 tablespoons of the ranch dressing mix in a large bowl until evenly coated.</li>
        <li>Top bottom half of rolls evenly with chicken mixture; sprinkle with remaining 3/4 cup cheese.</li>
        <li>Place top half of rolls over cheese. Brush tops and sides of rolls with melted butter. Sprinkle tops of rolls evenly with remaining 1/2 tablespoon ranch dressing mix.</li>
        <li>Bake in preheated oven until cheese is melted, tops of rolls are golden brown, and chicken mixture is heated through, about 10 minutes. Remove from oven, cut into 12 sliders and serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
